    description: 'Bus Mall is a sample product testing app for a hypothetical catalogue company testing products through a focus group. Three potential products are shown to each tester, who selects one by clicking on it. After twenty selections a chart is displayed with the number of votes each product has received both in nominal terms and as a percentage of votes cast, along with a link to a marketing report. Votes persist across multiple sessions.',
